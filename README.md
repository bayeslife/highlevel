A web based Bayesian Network tool for Decision Making

A bayesian network can be defined.
Nodes are either Categories of mutually exclusive Choices.

Choices connect to Capabilites which should arise from the Choices.

On Capability and Output nodes, the conditional probability given the Choices (or input Capabilities) can be defined.

The Output nodes are expected to represent the business outcomes that are desired and by varying the Choices one can see the impact on the Outputs by the diameter of the nodes.
